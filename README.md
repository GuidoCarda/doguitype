## Technologies

I used `React JS`, `Framer Motion`, `CSS3`

## Setup

- run `npm run dev` to get your development enviroment running

## Approach

- Focused on learing and aplying the use of custom hooks.
- Implemented a react context to manage the fetching of the words needed for the tests.
- Used maps and sets as a data structure to learn more about them and their diferent methods.
- I adopted and CSS variables aproach for the app theming.
